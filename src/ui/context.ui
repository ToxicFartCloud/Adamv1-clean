UI Refresh Notes — Current Session

Date: 2025-XX-XX

Major Updates
- Responsive scaling now lerps the CTk widget scale with a debounced (60 ms) resize handler.
- Sidebar moved into a PanedWindow: draggable sash, remembered width, collapsible stub with always-visible “+” button.
- Sidebar list rows render as rounded buttons with kabob menus, compact titles, and rename/delete handlers.
- Composer rebuilt around a centered frame: tk.Text input with character wrap, auto-grow up to 8 lines, vertical scrollbar, and rounded toolbar buttons (📎, 🖼️, 🎤, ⋯, 🗖, ✈️).
- Context menus added to composer input, sidebar search, and message code blocks (Cut/Copy/Paste/Select All).
- Global radii doubled across bubbles, sidebar shells, dropdowns, and action buttons for softer visuals.

Resize & Layout Behavior
- Window launches at 2400×1600 (min 980×620); composer width clamps to available content width while staying centered.
- Wrap length, composer compact toggle, and sidebar compact labels recalc on resize without jitter.
- Tk callback logger writes stack traces to tk_errors.log for easier debugging.

Composer Details
- tk.Text grows to 2× height (4→8 lines); once capped, scrollbar shows and caret stays visible.
- Character wrapping enforced after width/resize changes to keep long tokens inside the frame.
- Overflow menu placeholder remains for future attach/image/voice actions.

Sidebar & Navigation
- Collapse button in header flips between “−/+”; hiding swaps sidebar for the stub pane and restores prior width on expand.
- Stub pane keeps a persistent toggle visible even when collapsed.

Next Steps / Follow-Ups
- Wire kabob “Move to” submenu when Projects pane ships.
- Connect overflow actions to real commands and consider theming the stub button.
- Audit light theme to ensure new rounded components inherit correct colors.

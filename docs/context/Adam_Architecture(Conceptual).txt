ðŸ–¼ Adam Architecture (Conceptual Layout)
1. User Interaction Layer
UI (src/adam/ui/app.py + assets)
Notifications, chats, saved sessions (ui_data)
ðŸ“Œ Purpose: Human interface (desktop assistant UI).

2. Core Runtime
Core Engine (src/adam/core.py)
Run Entry (run_adam.py)
Server Runtime (src/adam/server/main.py)
Logging & Memory (src/adam/utils/*, /snapshots, /logs)
ðŸ“Œ Purpose: Adamâ€™s brain â€” handles requests, memory, logic, plugin orchestration.

3. Plugin Ecosystem
System Plugins: hardware_audit, backup_snapshot, proc_app, proc_ps
Cognitive Plugins: memory_search, memory_write, memory_summarize
LLM/Model Plugins: ollama_llm, model_router, model_update
Utility Plugins: git_ops, guard_approval, Web Search, wmgr
ðŸ“Œ Purpose: Extend Adamâ€™s abilities; modular approach allows upgrades, safe experiments, AIâ†”AI comms.

4. Sidecars & Distributed Services
Director (planning, routing): /sidecars/director
GitHub Publisher: /sidecars/github_publisher
SLED Runtime: /sidecars/sled
ðŸ“Œ Purpose: Externalized services for heavy lifting, orchestration, and third-party integrations.

5. Supporting Infrastructure
Configs (/config/*.yaml) â†’ Controls plugins, models, registry.
Docs/Specs (/docs/specs) â†’ Technical blueprints.
Eval & Tests (/eval, /tests) â†’ Continuous improvement, safety, feedback cycle.
ðŸ“Œ Purpose: Keep Adam testable, configurable, and maintainable.

6. Cloud & Storage Layer
First release: Google Cloud storage integration (WIP).
Future: Self-hosted cloud/DAO-driven infra.
ðŸ“Œ Purpose: Deliver customer projects + manage storage lifecycle (30-day free â†’ subscription).

# Adam Network Layout (3-Machine + Cloud Burst)

## Current Roles

### 1. Laptop (Tester Bot)
- **Purpose**: Acts as an "outside source" perspective for Adam.
- **Tasks**:
  - Run lightweight test scripts or bots.
  - Validate Adam’s outputs from another device.
  - Simulate end-user interactions.

### 2. Gaming PC (Dev + Workhorse)
- **Purpose**: Primary development and creative station.
- **Tasks**:
  - Coding Adam’s core.
  - Art/design work.
  - General software dev and testing.
- **Note**: Keep Adam’s heavy runtime tasks off this machine to stay responsive.

### 3. EVO-X2 Mini PC (AI Brain)
- **Purpose**: Dedicated AI workstation.
- **Specs**: AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395, up to 128GB LPDDR5X, dual M.2 storage.
- **Tasks**:
  - Host Adam’s main backend services (chat, RAG, eval, plugins).
  - Heavy inference tasks (LLMs, embeddings, batch jobs).
  - Training or fine-tuning (LoRA/QLoRA scale).
  - Central "brain" node in the home network.

## Future Expansion

### Cloud Burst (Runpod / Paperspace)
- **Purpose**: Handle compute-heavy overflow jobs.
- **Tasks**:
  - Training large models beyond local limits.
  - Big data processing or multi-node orchestration.
- **Guardrail**: Always check **Bank Account balance** before spin-up.

## Orchestration Plan
- **n8n** (self-hosted) can manage workflow orchestration between Laptop, Gaming PC, EVO-X2, and Cloud.
- Adam should understand which machine to use for which task and request confirmation if unsure.

## Benefits
- Keeps dev responsive (PC free from heavy loads).
- Separates testing vs. production vs. dev.
- Expandable: new nodes (servers, cloud) can join later.
